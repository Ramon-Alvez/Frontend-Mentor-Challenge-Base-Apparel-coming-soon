## Overview üî≠

### The challenge üèÜ

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process üíª‚úí

### Built with üß±üõ†

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned üìö

I learned how to prevent a form submit and how to submit him after validation, here is the func I used to it:

```js
form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
   
    if (email.value.length === 0 || !emailRejex.test(email.value)) addError()
    else {
        removeError()
        form.submit()
    }
})
```

I know I have a lot to improve, but i'm really proud about this challenge, I tried to make sure to use GRID and do it as responsible as I could, so if anyone have tips or feedbacks I'm open to it.

### Continued development üöÄ

Now my plan is to practice JS with Frontend Mentor challenges and continue studying React

### Useful resources üéí

- [Example resource 1](https://horadecodar.com.br/como-parar-envio-de-formulario-com-javascript/) - This helped me for discovering `preventDefault()`, and later ChatGPT told me about `submit()`.
